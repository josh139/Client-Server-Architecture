# ClientServer-Architecture
The idea of this project was to create a Server and a Client. The Server will provide the Client with pre-defined methods which the Client is able to utilise. I implemented this by completing the steps set out in the included "5COSC004W.2020.Tutorial.9.2021.03.18.pdf" document. I used NetBeans IDE 8.2 along with the GlashFish Server 4.1. The methods on the Server and their purpose include:

- ```isConnected()``` that takes no parameters and return the String “Connected”.
- ```getLongestStringBetween(String a, String b)``` which returns the longest of the two strings passed as Web Parameters.
- ```getLongestStringBetweenWithException(String a, String b)``` which returns the longest of the two strings passed as Web Parameters. The Web Method throws an Exception when one or both the passed parameters are null.
- ```addSampleOnServer(String s)``` which adds the passed String to the Server.

This is a very simple project completed as part of a tutorial during my studies at university.
